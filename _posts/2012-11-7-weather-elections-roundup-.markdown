We’ve been at this for about four months now, with much of our team’s work focused on the presidential campaign and this week’s elections. Here’s a rundown of some of our favorite projects:

###Fire Forecast

One of our first map apps, the forecast began as a complement to a series of radio stories about the wildfires. The project started as a more traditional visualization using the [many](http://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/fire_wx/), [many](http://inciweb.org/) sources of government data -- when and where fires occurred, how large they grew, and how much they destroyed. 

But it morphed into something that actually be more useful today: a [localizable map](http://npr.org/wildfires) showing the government’s daily forecast of fire danger and the location of large fires.

The app is responsive to various screen sizes, and functions nicely on (most) mobile devices. On the iPhone, there’s even a handy tool tip that allows users to bookmark the app to their home screens.

###Mapping the drought

This [map](http://www.npr.org/2012/07/18/156989764/interactive-mapping-the-u-s-drought) morphed from an [interactive](http://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/drought/) built by the NPR StateImpact team focusing on the historic Texas drought of 2011:

>Texas experienced its worst drought on record last year. Now that the state is seeing some relief, drought conditions have consumed more than half the United States. Use this interactive map and chart to see how conditions have changed over time.

When the drought reached historic levels across the country, we used similar code and national data to expand the chart and extend the map. It has a play button so users can see the dry conditions expand across the country over time, and the chart allows users to see the ground area covered by drought over the years.

###Early voting

As the election approached, our elections team wanted a list of states and their early voting rules. What resulted was a responsive page that gave readers information about key deadlines in their respective dates for registration and early or absentee voting, among other useful information.

Designer Allison Hurt added these calendars to give the list visual elements and make the key date ranges more digestible:
